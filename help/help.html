<h1>HELP: Job Scheduler</h1>
<p>Job Scheduler (job-scheduler) is a gui frontend to the crontab task scheduling system, 
<br>a long standing linux standard, providing some convienence features such as help with 
<br>cron time code formatting and setting of environment variables.</p>

<h2>Command Tab</h2>

<p>The opening tab for job-scheduler shows the current task profiles in the left pane 
<br>and a job editor in the right pane.  The currently selected job from the left is displayed
<br>in the right pane.</p>

<p>Clicking the "New Item" button in the toolbar will start a new entry for editing.  
<br>The user can manually enter a cron job here.  The "Reload" button in the toolbar 
<br>will reload the last saved job list.</p>

<p>The schedule for the task appears at the bottom of the Command Pane, showing 
<br>actual time the task will be launched.  This list changes as the user formats 
<br>the cron time format string either directly or via the Edit button.</p>

<p>No changes to the cron job schedule will take place until the "Save" button is executed.</p>

<p>Selecting the "Time Settings Editor" button in the Command pane will open the 
<br>Time Settings Editor to help the user with time formatting.  It is possible 
<br>to select multiple time buttons, each affecting a different area of the 
<br>cron time format string, which the user can see change in real time</p>

<p>The buttons are actual numbers on the clock face.  So "5" under Minutes is 5 minutes 
<br>after the hour.   2 under Hours is 2:00 in the morning.  The cron time format string
<br>will be generated as you select numbers.

<h2>Variables Tab</h2>

<p>The Variables tab of the right pane allows the user to set up certain 
<br>environment variables the the task may require.  By default, PATH, SHELL, and HOME
<br>are already set.</p>

<h2>Job List Tab</h2>

<p>The Job List tab shows all currently scheduled jobs and when they will run.  
<br>The user may filter the list via the "Max Item" and "Max Date" boxes at the 
<br>bottom of the tab.  Changing values and pressing "Update" will change the list</p>

<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Job Scheduler shows jobs on a per-user basis</li>
		<li>If you want to edit a root level task, launch the app as root (sudo, gksu, mx-pkexec, etc...)</li>
		<li>Jobs scheduled via methods other than crontab may not show in Job Scheduler</li>
	</ul>
